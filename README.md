# How to Run Your E-Portfolio HTML Code

## Simple Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Save the HTML Code
1. Copy all the HTML code I provided earlier
2. Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or TextEdit)
3. Paste the code into the text editor
4. Save the file as `index.html` (make sure to select "All Files" as file type if using Notepad)


### 3. Run the E-Portfolio
1. Simply double-click the `index.html` file you saved
2. It will automatically open in your default web browser
3. You should now see your complete e-portfolio

## Folder Structure
Make sure your files are organized like this:
```
your-folder/
├── index.html
└── images/
    └── profile.jpg
```


That's it! No need to install any software or set up servers - just save the HTML file and open it in your browser.
